validate and record payments.

If the `logs` query parameter is provided, returns a list of `CreditAccount`
log entries (instead of their net balance). The list returned has the following
format and is ordered by the timestamp:
```

The array returned has the following format:
```

    "firstDay":  <first day of this interval in UTC, YYYY-MM-DD: string>,
    "endTime":   <end time for this interval>,
    "lastDay":   <last day of this interval>,
